    ## useDebouncedCallback

    Custom hook that creates a debounced version of a callback function. This helps prevent a function from being called too frequently, useful in scenarios like handling scroll events, window resizing, or search input, where multiple rapid calls to a function might be costly or unnecessary.

    #### Parameters

    - **`func`**: The callback function you want to debounce. It will only be executed after the debounce period.

    - **`wait`** (optional): The delay time in milliseconds before the callback function is invoked. If not provided, the default is typically a short delay, but you can set it as per your needs.

    #### Returns

    - Returns a debounced version of the provided `func` that will be triggered after the specified `wait` period.

    #### Usage

    ```js
    import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
    import useDebouncedCallback from './useDebouncedCallback';

    const MyComponent = () => {
    const handleClick = (event) => {
        console.log('Button clicked', event);
    };

    const debouncedHandleClick = useDebouncedCallback(handleClick, 300); // Debounce with a 300ms delay.

    return (
        <button onClick={debouncedHandleClick}>Click Me</button>
        )
        };

    export default MyComponent;
```
#### Notes

-   The debounce logic ensures that the func is only executed once after the user has stopped triggering the event for a specified wait period.
-   It's useful for improving performance when functions are called in quick succession (e.g., input events, scrolling, resizing).
-   This hook uses window.setTimeout to delay the invocation of the function and clearTimeout to cancel any pending invocations if the function is called again before the delay completes.
