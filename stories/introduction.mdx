# The <b style={{color: '#E90789'}}>Gene UI</b> design system's core components introduction
<br/>

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between'}}>
    <p>
        The Gene UI is a design system created by [SoftConstruct](https://softconstruct.com/ "title") to make building
        blocks groomed under back-office-like products. <br/> As this documentation is more technical, please read about
        the design language on our entire [documentation website.](link-to-documentation) <br/> The main mission of
        this design system is to <b>Democratize a UI unification process</b> <br/> by highlighting the best practice
        borders based
        on our robust experience in back-office products. <br/> This design system is built based on [Atomic
        design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
        methodology. Design system library currently created only for [React](https://reactjs.org/) library and supports
        v16.8.1 version.

## Guide to explore components more effectively.
<br />

### Hierarchy
<p>
    In the left sidebar presented components with their variations.
    <br /> Components are grouped by their scope's following the [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
    methodology.
</p>

     **Atoms**
<p>
    In the Atomic Design methodology context, "atoms" are the first level of the design system hierarchy, preceding molecules.<br />
    Atoms are the basic building blocks of a design system.<br />
    They are the smallest and simplest UI elements, such as buttons, inputs, labels, icons etc.<br />
    Atoms cannot be broken down any further without losing their meaning or functionality.<br />
    They are often reusable and can be combined with other atoms to create more complex UI elements, such as molecules and organisms.
</p>
    <br />
    **Molecules**
    <p>
    In the context of the Atomic Design methodology, "molecules" are the second level of the design system hierarchy, following atoms and preceding organisms.<br />
    Molecules are made up of two or more atoms that are grouped together to form a distinct functional unit.<br />
    They are the building blocks for more complex UI components, and can be used in multiple contexts throughout the design system.<br />
    Molecules are often designed to be modular and reusable, so that they can be easily combined with other molecules and organisms to create larger, more complex interfaces.<br />
    In summary, in the Atomic Design methodology, molecules are functional UI components made up of two or more atoms that can be combined to form more complex organisms.<br />
    They are designed to be modular and reusable, and are an essential building block in the creation of a cohesive and flexible design system.
</p>
    <br />
    **Organisms**
    <p>
    In the Atomic Design methodology context, "organisms" are the third level of the design system hierarchy, following atoms and molecules.<br />
    Organisms are made up of groups of molecules and/or atoms that work together to form a more significant, more complex UI component.<br />
    They are the next step up from molecules and are designed to be used as functional parts of a layout or page.<br />
    Organisms are designed to be modular and reusable so that they can be easily combined with other organisms and molecules to create complete interfaces.<br />
    In summary, in the Atomic Design methodology, organisms are larger UI components made up of groups of molecules and/or atoms that work together to form a functional part of a layout or page.<br />
    They are designed to be modular and reusable and are an essential part of creating a cohesive and flexible design system.
</p>
    <br />
    **Charts**
    <p>
    In the context of the Atomic Design methodology, charts are not typically included as a component in the atomic design system hierarchy,<br/>
    as they are usually more complex UI components that require their own unique design considerations.<br/>
    However, charts can still be incorporated into a design system by treating them as standalone UI components and using them in a modular and reusable way.<br/>
    This can be done by designing a set of chart components that can be easily customized and reused in different contexts.<br/>
    In this design system to provide chart visualizations are used [Highcharts v10.2.1](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) as a third party library.

<div id="component-stages">
    ### Component stages
    <p>
        Suppose you see one of the below-listed icons on the right side of the component. <br />
        It means the component has a specially marked stage. <br />
        More detailed context is below about component stages.
    </p>
</div>

-   <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <img style={{ width: '16px', 'margin-right': '8px' }} src={experimentalBadge} />
    <b>experimental</b>
    </div>
    <p>
        When a component is described as experimental on the Gene UI storybook, it means that the component is nascent
        and immature and is currently in the process of being added to the Gene UI components package (or being considered for
        addition). Marking a component as experimental indicates that readers should think carefully before using that
        component in any kind of production project (i.e., a project that is not just a demo or experiment). Readers are
        encouraged to try out experimental components and provide feedback to design system maintainers.
    </p>
-   <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
        <img style={{ width: '16px', 'margin-right': '8px' }} src={deprecatedBadge} />
        <b>deprecated</b>
    </div>
    <p>
        The term deprecated on the Gene UI storybook is used to mark a component that is no longer recommended. A
        deprecated component will be removed in future versions of the package. We recommend to avoid using the
        component marked as deprecated, and if you already use the deprecated component, make sure before upgrading to a
        new version of the package, as the component may be removed from a higher version. You can check the changelog
        to know each version changes.
    </p>
<br />
### Playground
<p>
    The Playground tab in the Storybook allows you to experiment with your components interactively, testing different props and seeing how they affect their behavior and appearance.<br />
    To use the Playground tab, select a component from the left-hand sidebar. Once the component is selected, click the Playground tab in the top menu bar.<br />
    In the Playground tab, you'll see a live preview of the component with all its props listed below.<br />
    In real-time, you can modify these props from the right-hand sidebar from the controls panel and see the changes reflected immediately in the preview.<br />
    As you modify props, you'll see the prop values update in the URL, allowing you to share your Playground session with others by simply copying and sharing the URL.<br />
    The Playground tab can help you quickly prototype and experiment with different component variations.
</p>
<br />

### Controls
<p>
    The Controls tab in Storybook allows you to customize and tweak your component props to see how they affect the component's behavior and appearance.<br />
    To use the Controls tab, select a component from the left-hand sidebar. Once the component is selected, click the Controls tab in the right-hand sidebar.<br />
    In the Controls tab, you'll see a list of all the props available for the component and their current values.<br />
    You can modify these props by clicking on the (input, dropdown, and radio button) fields next to each prop and entering a new value.<br />
    As you modify props, you'll see the changes reflected in real time in the component preview. This makes it easy to see how different prop values affect the component's behavior and appearance.<br />
    Using the Controls tab can help you fine-tune your components and ensure they look and behave as expected.<br />
    It can also make it easy to experiment with different prop values and see how they affect your component in different use cases.
</p>
<br />

### Actions
<p>
    The Actions tab in Storybook allows you to see logs on events and actions that occur in your components, making it easier to test and debug your code.<br />
    To use the Actions tab, select a component from the left-hand sidebar. Once the component is selected, click the Actions tab in the right-hand sidebar.<br />
    You'll see a list of all the actions logged for the component in the Actions tab. You can log new actions by interacting with component events like click, blur, hover, etc.<br />
    As you log interact with the component, action logs appear in real-time in the Actions tab.<br />
    This can be especially useful for testing user interactions and ensuring your components work as expected.<br />
    Using the Actions tab can help you quickly diagnose and fix issues in your components, improving your code's overall quality and reliability.
</p>
<br />

### Docs
<p>
    The "Docs" tab at the top of the viewport provides detailed information about each component prop.<br />
    A table displays all supported props along with their descriptions, detailing how each prop will affect the component, the possible values for each prop, and their default values.<br />
    In addition, to prop information, the "Docs" tab also displays all stories related to the specific component.<br />
    This allows users to view examples of the component in different use cases, making it easier to understand how the component can be used effectively in different scenarios.<br />
</p>
<br />

### Accessibility
<p>
    [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/), which stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, is a set of guidelines and specifications developed by the [W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)](https://www.w3.org/)<br />
    to improve the accessibility of web content and applications for people with disabilities.<br />
    The Gene UI design system is extended to ARIA standards and implemented for each component scope.
</p>
<br />

### Version selector
The version selector dropdown in the left sidebar under the SoftConstruct logo gives a chance to travel via Gene UI version history.

## Supported browsers
<p>
    We actively support the following browsers on desktop and mobile devices. <b>For each, we support the current and
    previous major releases only.</b>
</p>
<img src={browsersSupport} />
<br />

## Versioning.
<p>
    Gene UI has a release cycle where all breaking changes are batched into major releases. We follow the pattern known
    as [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200), which describes how we change the version
    number for each release of Gene UI based on what types of changes it has. This approach guarantees users of Gene UI
    what to expect when upgrading Gene UI. The version number of Gene UI has three numbers separated by dots, which are
    referred to as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. For version 2.7.4, 2 is the MAJOR value, 7 is the MINOR value, and 4 is the PATCH
    value. <br />
    <br /> ◦ A MAJOR release may contain breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. v<b>2</b>.7.4
    <br /> ◦ A MINOR release may contain a new feature and bug fixes. v2.<b>7</b>.4 <br /> ◦ A PATCH release contains
    only bug fixes. v2.7.<b>4</b> <br />
    By knowing the version of Gene UI you are using, you can figure out what features are available. You also can see what
    features have been added that you cannot use unless you update, which may provide an incentive to update.
